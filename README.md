This research project investigates the rising failure rates in Nigeria’s Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) exams between 2020 and 2025, and forecasts performance trends through 2030. Using a survey of 54 respondents and analysis techniques including descriptive statistics, correlation studies, and machine learning models, the study identifies key factors affecting JAMB outcomes and provides actionable recommendations for stakeholders.
Key Findings:
* Performance Overview: Average score was 224.9 out of 400, with most students scoring in the 200–250 range. Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics were most frequently cited as difficult subjects.
* Demographics: Slightly more females (33) than males (19) participated; most were aged 16–19. Performance was largely consistent across genders and regions, though private school students outperformed public school peers significantly (90% vs 56% admission rate).
* Predictive Insights: Random Forest models indicated that exam center facilities and school type were strong predictors of success. Logistic regression achieved 91% accuracy in predicting admission.
* Forecasts (2026–2030): Under moderate scenarios, success rates are projected to hover around 34–36%, with 64–66% failing, assuming incremental improvements in educational infrastructure.
Recommendations:
* Strengthen STEM education through better training and resources.
* Improve CBT center quality and student familiarity with the format.
* Target low-performing states with support programs and replicate success models from high-performing areas like Edo and Abuja.
* Expand public-private collaboration to address inequality in school resourcing.
Limitations:
 Small sample size and self-reporting bias may limit generalizability. Nonetheless, the study offers a data-driven foundation for educational policy reform.
